At the end of shift, each employee is entitled to one drink - or ten. As Tess sips her wine, Simone teaches her about the coding of our tongues: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, leading Tess to become even more enthralled by Simone. Sasha then recruits Tess to find his missing “green card wife.” Along the way, Tess finds out where everyone goes after they’ve clocked out for the night.",

The next shift, Tess meets Serena, an alumna of the restaurant who married one of their wealthiest guests, Fred Benson. Serena and Simone were best friends until Serena chose to leave the restaurant and settle down. To Tess, Serena has the picture-perfect New York life. But Simone teaches Tess not to believe everything she sees.",

She goes to an art museum, where she runs into a childhood friend and her mother. They startle her, and her life doesn’t sound as impressive as it feels. Her day is definitely not going as planned. Tess decides to go to Simone’s apartment unannounced to borrow her wine books. Simone’s apartment is all Tess could hope for: filled with artifacts from traveling the world, various books Simone has read, and a perfect bathtub directly in the middle of the kitchen. After Simone invites Tess into her intimate world, her abrupt expulsion leaves Tess lonelier than ever. She goes back to the only place she knows: the restaurant.",

The dishwasher is broken, a hostess and bartender are missing, and Sasha is upset that Howard still will not promote him to server. After an exhausting and chaotic shift, Tess and Sasha embark on a drug-fueled night of dancing and adventure to burn off the stress of work. They follow Ari from her DJ set at a club to her surprisingly fancy apartment, all while reflecting on the many flaws of the restaurant. Tess keeps thinking things couldn’t get any worse, until the night takes a dangerous turn.",

Today is her final exam, and she will either pass her trails and be hired as a backwaiter, or fail and lose her newfound family for good. Tess is initially desperate to do well on her last day of trails, but the day’s events make her question if this job is really worth it. The blows keep coming as Tess learns more about her coworkers, injures herself, and makes a mistake that could endanger her chances of being hired at all. On the brink of joining the restaurant family as a backwaiter, Tess asks herself: do I really want this?",
