	"synopsis":[
		"As the Calloways continue to grow as a family, season 4 takes a deeper dive into each character as they wrestle with adulthood and the secrets of their past. Life off the court continues to be a bigger game than the one on the court - and the human struggle doesn't go away, no matter how much money or success they have. Grounded in relevant, true-to-life struggles, the critically–acclaimed series continues to tackle real-life current issues, no–holds– barred – and with a unique comedic touch."
